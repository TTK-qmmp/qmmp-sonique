Hello sonique fans !!!

a new Visual flying out to you !!!
It performs some kind of a cosmic "belt" made out of
anti aliased and coloured lines being stretched and
moved by the music. There are also some light particles
inside the tunnel and a rotated starfield in the background.

Several values can be changed in the vis.ini file !!!

watch out for these lines in the vis.ini located in
your sonique\ directory

these setting appear after you started the visual the first time in your Sonique player

[CoR's Cosmic Belt 1.2]
Star_Speed=3.0					-> negative values allowed
Number_of_Stars(max_1000)=400			-> integer value, 0 = no stars
Particle_Speed=-2.0				-> also positive values allowed
Particle_Size=15.0				-> for slow PC I recommed to use small values
Number_of_Particles(max_100)=20			-> to turn them of setit to 0
Camera_Rotation_Speed=0.3			-> speed of the camera moving around the belt

try Star_Speed 10.0 for a lightning fast ride through the universe !!!

when changed some of the settings save the vis.ini and restart Sonique !

to reset to default values delete then restart Sonique.




have fun...

CoR

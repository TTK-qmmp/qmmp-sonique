1. About/History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	I first saw this effect in a german PCMag (you own PCMagazin ;D) coded by
	Nils Pipenbrinck when they were introducing vis plugin programming for winamp.
	The 'simple' movelist effect amazed me so I decided to port it to sonique.
	As for the performance it's a lot less resource consuming than my previous
	plugins. It should run quite well on any decent system (assuming you don't run
	in huge fullscreen modes).

2. Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Really not much, runs quite fine with most systems.
	Tends to get a bit messy when you play loud music and have it running in small
	vis areas such as vismode.

3. Configuring Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	If you have Sonique 1.0x+ the settings of the plugins get stored in the file called
	vis.ini in your Sonique directory each time you close Sonique.
	NOTE:	When you edit vis.ini while sonique is running be sure to save your changes
		AFTER you closed Sonique. WetNad will save (and overwrite old ones!) the settings
		it currently uses each time Sonique is closed.
	Here are the descriptions of the Config keys:
	
	[starwave]
	
	DrawSweep=1
		; Wether to draw the random screen-sweeps or not (1=ON, 0=OFF, default=ON)
	
	CycleColors=1
		; Cycle through the colors or use a fixed one (1=cycle, 0=fixed, default=cycle)
	
	FixedColorR=255
	FixedColorG=255
	FixedColorB=255
		; Red Green and Blue values of the color to use when using FixedColor mode.

4. FAQ
~~~~~~~
Q: How do I install this plugin?
A: Copy the file called "starwave.svp" into the Folder called "Vis" in your Sonique Folder.
   If you recieved this as a Executable file just doubleclick on it and your are set.

Q: I don't have a vis.ini in my Sonique Folder?
A: You probably are running an old version of Sonique. In this case the settings are
   stored in c:\windows\sonique.ini

Q: Will there be new versions with more features?
A: Not sure yet.

Q: My changes to vis.ini seem to be ignored. What do I do wrong?
A: Be sure to save your changes AFTER(!) you closed Sonique.

Q: Can I have the source??
A: No. Two reasons: 1) It's incredibely messy right now. 2) I just don't feel like it.

Q: What did you program this plugin in?
A: Microsoft Visual C++ 6

Q: I have a few ideas for the plugin. Can I tell them to you?
A: Yes. Feel free to email any comments, bug reports, ideas, suggestions to xplo@xploded.net

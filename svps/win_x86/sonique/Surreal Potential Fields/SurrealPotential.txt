Surreal Potential Soniuqe Plugin v1.0
Written by Brenden Tennant

Each point that you see floating around is a gravitational field.
The 12 fields are integrated for each pixel to determine the shape
of the overall field.  Field strengths are determined by spectral
segments of the signal.  Range of movement and speed is determined
by signal VU levels.  I've optimized this in assembly and it runs
smoothly in all screen modes on my PII 400 Celeron.

Enjoy.

     This is a simple Fractal tree, with parameters synchronized 
  to the music. There are no parameters you can change, to customize 
  the plugin. It was developed only in about four hours, so if there
  are any bugs, please report them to karagian@aetos.it.teithe.gr

  Changes from version 1:
    - Added color changing
    - Fractal is more sensitive to the music. More Psycho...

  Hope you enjoy it.

Xoo - A Sonique Visual Plugin
Version 1.0 (29th Nov 1999)
Produced by MiNDCUBE ( grk@mindcube.net )


Intro
-----
Not a lot to say about this really. Looks cool with some tracks, not so good
with others, ho hum..

To see the effect I had in mind, try the Tantrance album, second disc, track
7, "Galaxian". :-)


Configuration Options
---------------------
You can set the diversity of the palette used, look in the VIS.INI file
for the [Xoo v1.0] section, notice the "palette=258"? 

You can set the "palette" value to anything you like... although only values
in the range 2-516 are used. Default is 258.


Effect Settings
---------------
Sonique's internal effects are ignored.


General
-------
Apologies if this is a bit of a CPU drain, it's not been optimised at all, I was
just tweaking bits 'n bobs until I was happy with the look. If anyone wants a
quicker version drop me an email, it works OK on a PIII-450. This was knocked
up in MSVC++ 6.

Hope someone likes it!

Enjoy

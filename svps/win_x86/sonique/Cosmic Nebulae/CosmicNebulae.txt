Hi sonique users...

you'll need MMX to run this visual !

this is the visual concept of Cosmic Nebulae, 
The vis itself is not a new concept but it has
one new aspect: this vis has no fixed movemaps
like smear and acidspunc have several and nice
ones (I think both are great visuals !!!).

This one smoothly zoomes and rotates the 
background and draws some pixels onto it...
Like this it can have more synch to music.
looks best with hiphop, drum'n'bass, techno and 
most mods.

I just felt I won't have much time to work on
this concept in near future... so I'll release
this version - otherwise it would lay around here.

So I hope you'll like it...

my favourite resolution is 512x368 32bpp fullscreen
on a PIII 500

!!!!!
Watch it wearing sunglasses, but be sure only to
cover ONE eye by the sun glasses...

Try this with cosmic belt too !!

Thanks to HB for help with MMX !!!

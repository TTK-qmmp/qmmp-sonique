Description/Instructions:
	It must be christmas.  Strange that someone who lives in
	the Southern hemisphere is writing a vis that has snow
	as some sort of a christmas theme.  Never mind, it's
	pretty.

Config:
	The following configuration options for the faited plugin are
	available in the [snowvis] section on the vis.ini file.

	NoBigFlakes=0 or 1
		If 1 then there are none of the larger 'stylized'
		flakes.

	NoInternals=0 or 1
		If 1 then the internal images are used and only
		those found in the directory are used for backgrounds.
		See below.

	Shaker=0 or 1
		If 1 then snow doesn't fall unless you shake the
		sonique window.  A real life snow dome.

	Also, additional background images can be used in conjuction
	with, or instead of, the ones supplied.  Simply place the
	files (which must be jpg files) in the same directory as
	the snowvis.svp file.  The files probably should be about
	300x200 in size, but theoretically most should work.

	UPDATE: I forgot to mention, the files must have a filename
	that matches SnowVis_*.jpg (e.g. SnowVis_MyImage.jpg)

	Also, if you are running sonique version 1.30 or later you
	can add a handful of snow by clicking on the vis window in
	vis mode.

	Enjoy

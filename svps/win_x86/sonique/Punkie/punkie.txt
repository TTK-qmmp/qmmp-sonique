Punkie v1.7 for Sonique
Copyright (c) 2000 By Pascal Dallongeville

Punkie is just a little 'blur-zoom', it was originally designed for winamp.
It is less faster than winamp version (because it doesn't need 8 to 32 bpp conversion) and 
the configuration can anly be changed by editing the vis.ini file in 'punkie' section.


FEATURES in version 1.7 :
-------------------------

- 8 bpp and fullcolor mode support
- 26 waveforms which 3 types each
- 5 effects with 4 types of drawing
- 4 styles for shape effects
- 26 palettes (15 normals and 11 'stranges')
- differents zooms that react to music.
- Mirror effect (to improve speed on very slow computer)
- A blur and fadeout rendering
- A lot of presets ...
- A Fast Render Mode option


CONFIGURATION :
---------------
Edit the vis.ini file (in the Sonique subdirectory)

* Hor_Mirror: Horizontal Mirror effect, it is faster (ideal for slow computer), set
this value to 1 to enabled it (otherwise, let it to 0, the default value)

* Coef_Pal_Coarse: Coeficient of 'stranges' palettes use. choose a value from 0 to 10 (3 by default).
3 -> 30% to have a 'strange' palette, 0: never use 'stranges' palettes, 10: always use it.

* Nb_Fps_Between_Pal: Number of fps betwwen a palette fade (palette change) -> from 0 to 1000 (default 200).
0 means that actual palette color will always fade to another.

* Delay_preset: Number of milliseconds betwwen two differents sets of effects: from 500 (0,5 sec)
to 20000 (20 sec). the preset is changed each 'Delay_Preset' milliseconds. Default = 5000.

* Dec_Fade: (for 8 bpp mdoe only) coeficient of fadeout. from 0 (no fadeout) to 10 (strong fadeout). A strong fadeout give more black color on the screen (this feature work better with MMX). Default value = 6.

* Render_8_Bpp: 8 bits per pixel mode (faster but less colors) : 1 enabled it, 0 enabled 32 bpp

* Inc_Color_32: (for 32 bpp mode only) incrementation of the cycling color waveform (8 by default, put a value between 1 and 20)

* FastRender: Fast Render Mode: 1 = enabled, 0 = disabled (by default)
I recommend use it with trance, techno musics since Punkie react a lot on bass...

There are not required hardware (maybe a least a 486 DX type processor) for 8 bpp color mode.
But you need a MMX Processor for fullcolor mode (Render_8_Bpp = 0).
But I recommend you to have a fast processor and a fast 2D video card (3D is not usefull for this plugin).
MMX is recommend too otherwise because the effects will look not as good without (but not slower :) ).

Hope you'll Enjoy It !!

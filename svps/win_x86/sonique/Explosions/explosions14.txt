1.4 bug removed (before it crashed with some skins - clipping error)

1.3 features more realistic and changeable colors

1.2 includes better synch to music !! (adjustable)


It shows explosions detonating to the music.
Coding was fun because it was so simple.
The code flew aout of my hands like nothing.
I think it is because of the many eMails I
got last days which made me grow in confidence.

Thanks you all !!!!!!

In vis.ini you can change the max number of
explosion particles for performance reasons.

default = 500

Now you can also adjust the volume sensitivity
to change the explosions origin to the beat.

default = 40 (the less the value is, the more often the
		new explosion changes it's origin);


color 0 - 4 define the colors of the palette 
            in  r g b - order (hexadecimal)

color Smoothness determines the smoothness of the palette
default 170


Have fun and enjoy

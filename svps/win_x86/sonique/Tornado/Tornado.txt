     - Tornado 1.1 -

a Sonique visual plugin by

   Robert Wenzel (CoR)

 written in about 2 days.


This plugin rotates and distorts a basic form according to the music
using the spectrum analyser for colors and rotation speed.
(Sorry no changes possible, effect, blur and zoom are turned off)
But I think it's a very cool effect.

It looks best with powerful music (Hip-Hop, Techno, Metal)
just loud music with many changes in the base and heights.

It is very processor intensive for the picture is rendered pixel by pixel.
Should look good on a P200 or higher.

the file   TornadoVis11.svp is the original effect and
the plugin TornadoBVis11.svp is another sightly modified clone of that effect !!!

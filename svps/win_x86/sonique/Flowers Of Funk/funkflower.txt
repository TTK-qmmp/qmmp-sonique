info : 

	This Plugin was made in about a 3 - 4 hours and is my first fiddle with the sonique vis API it is a basic Spectal anaysis spun round the screen's center clipping @ 65 and multiplyed by 5(? and i can't be bothered to look @ my code) and reflected 8 times. the images r hard coded not generated and applyed the the buffer. hue rotation is no longer faked but enhaced by some of the old (faked) code :P .

Things i wanna do :

	* put in some real hue rotation (done v1.2b)
	* more inline coding (done v1.2b)
	* better bass enhancement
	* options ("for what?" i here u ask "tune in next week!")
